>possible rewrite of abstract

The aim of this project is two-fold: primarily we aim to evaluate the limits of machine accuracy in the context of solving differential equations, and it functions as an introduction to problem solving in C++. We will be comparing the efficiency of vector and matrix methods of storage with respect to computation time while exercising basic C++ skills (i.e. dynamic memory allocation, compiling of cpp files, etc.). 

>notes on intro:
  - none thus far (will return)

>Math motiv:
  -possible rewrite of opening sentance (identicle structure to the abstract) although utilitarian it repetition can be dangerous
		*can also redo the opening of the abstract;
  	"the primary goal of this project is <machine accuracy bit>... and secondarily <C++>

  - line break after "closed form solution given by..." for aethetics
 
>Algorithmssssss
  -can we get the matrix and the vectors on the same line? (low priority)
  -other than that we just need to finish it

>Error discussion
  -comment that the method is standard? 
  -wording: "we elected to [sample] one [error entry <aside> specifically the first entry </aside> fro the sake of efficiency]"
  -discuss in terms of step size (we can approximate the order of 10) as opposed to the index i (for clearity)

>figure 1:
  - probably fine unless we write something wierd for results discussion
